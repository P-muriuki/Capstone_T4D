# Capstone_T4D
This is a collaborative project to finish my fellowship under tech4dev. 
We are solving product quality issues involved with logistics. Better yet, connecting competent drivers with small/medium-sized entrepreneurs and their consumers in Nigeria. It is a hypothetical claim and using data we can find what consumer value most and if we have a willing market.
